CSE154 CP1 Showcase Options

We encourage students to opt-in to each quarter's Creative Project Showcase to
showcase creativity, design, fun, utility, exploration, etc. and you do not need
to go above and beyond to be featured (as long as the work is appropriate and you
are citing external sources in your page, such as public images).

If you would like to opt-in to the website's CP1 Showcase (check the box in the GitGrade submission process), please also let us know which of the following you would like included:
- about.html: YES
- other .html files: YES
- wireframes: YES
- 404.html (late day challenge): YES
