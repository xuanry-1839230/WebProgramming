      <h4>Hi I'm Susan. Welcome to my page!</h4>
      <p>
        I'm currently a rising sophomore at the University of Washington, I am currently a
        pre-science major, and I'm looking to apply to ACMS major at the end of the summer. I am
        taking 3 classes this summer quarter(because I have nothing better to do), including 2 math
        classes and one CSE class. I will also be traveling during the last month of summer.

        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure.

          <p>
            It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was
            the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it
            was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
            was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we
            were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the
            period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
            insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of
            comparison only.
